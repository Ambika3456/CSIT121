      <h2>The Tools & Techniques I Mastered</h2>
      <p>Here I serve as a reflection of my skills, experiences, and growth as I pursue a career in Information Technology. I’m passionate about IT, especially in webpage designing and networking and this portfolio shows my journey, from projects and coursework to personal achievements.</p>
      <p>This page shows the projects and assignments I worked through the semester. In the beginning of the course, I learned how to use basic tags and attributes to structure and format content. Such as creating paragraphs, making text bold or italic, inserting line breaks, and building both ordered and unordered lists.</p>
      <p>Each Module provides hands-on practice and helped me understand key concepts like parent, child, and sibling relationships in HTML structure. I also explored important attributes such as id, class, title and style, which play vital role in organizing content in a webpage.  
        As the course progressed, I learned to design and build webpages more effectively, using CSS for layout and design. These techniques allow me to build my webpage user-friendly. Today I’m proud to create and design web page on my own style that I’ve learned throughout the semester.
